**General Solution Overview**

The Verilog module implemented is intended for processing RGB images of size 64x64 pixels. Each pixel is represented by 24 bits, with 8 bits for each color channel (R, G, B). The module performs the following operations on the image:

- **Image Mirroring:** The image is vertically mirrored.
- **Grayscale Transformation:** The mirrored image is transformed into grayscale by calculating, for each pixel, the average between the maximum and minimum values from the R, G, and B channels.
- **Application of Sharpness Filter:** This part is not yet implemented in the provided code.

**Algorithm Description:**

**Image Mirroring (STATE_MIRROR)**

- Iterate through each pixel of the image.
- For each pixel, calculate its vertically mirrored position.
- Read the pixel from the original position and write it to the mirrored position.
- The process continues until all pixels have been processed.

**Grayscale Transformation (STATE_GRAYSCALE)**

- Iterate through each pixel of the mirrored image.
- Extract the R, G, and B channel values of each pixel.
- Calculate the maximum and minimum values among these values.
- Calculate the average between the maximum and minimum and set this value in the G channel.
- Set the R and B channels to 0.
- The process continues until all pixels have been processed.

**Explanation of Complex Portions of Implementation**

- **Calculation of Mirrored Position**
  - The mirrored position of a pixel is calculated by reversing the order of columns. This is achieved by the formula `write_col <= 63 - col;`.

- **Calculation of Grayscale Value**
  - The grayscale value is calculated as the average between the maximum and minimum values of the R, G, and B channels of each pixel. This is a simple yet efficient method to obtain a representation of the image in grayscale tones.

**Other Relevant Details**

- **Machine States:** The module uses a finite state machine to manage the various stages of image processing.
- **Synchronization:** All operations are synchronized with the clock signal (clk).
- **Control Signals:** The `mirror_done` and `gray_done` signals are used to indicate the completion of the respective processing stages.
- **Unimplemented Part:** The sharpness filter is not yet implemented in the provided code.
